                I'm here to display my best skills and talents and make it easy to understand what I excel at. This is for those that need an introduction to who I am and know what makes me unique.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently I am a freshman attending school at BYU Idaho working on my Bachelorâ€™s degree in computer science. I have always been passionate about technology and want to find a career in technology that allows me to build my skills. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I am also currently working for the Information Technology department at BYU Idaho. The job has helped me find what kind of a workplace I want and what kind of work I want to do. I really like working here because it not only Is building my technology skills, but also my people skills as I work with the faculty and students on campus. 
            </p>

                One of my personal skills that I am building is my leadership skills. I have many different leadership opportunities right now at work and in my personal life. I am over a few different groups and have been learning how to make decisions with confidence while understanding others and their concerns. I have learned to take criticism and become better through failures and successes alike.
