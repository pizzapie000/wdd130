      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        My website will be for those that want to learn more about what I am skilled at as well as the different work that I have done. It will display my work in many different aspects of my life and organize them appropriately. It will be a helpful tool for me when I am searching for jobs or if I end up opening a business in the future. It will also help me accomplish my own goals. Overall, I hope it will be a useful tool for me to present myself, my work, and my creativity to a wider audience. I plan on using it to achieve my own personal goals and possibly help me land a job in the future as well. Many people attempting to find a job in the tech industry have their own portfolios on LinkedIn. I want my website to reflect my own style and have the kind of flow that I would like it to have. I will be able to add my own images and menus to make it very user friendly and easy to understand. I can have a spot with my contact information so that they can reach out to me. I can even add my resume or other files of mine for future employers. As time goes on, Iâ€™ll be able to update the files with newer information. The nice part about a webpage is that I can always have it running and it is accessible to anyone.

      </ul>
      <h3>Professional Work</h3>
      <p>
        One of the things that can be a struggle for me is networking. This website will provide a way for me to connect with other peers, clients, or employers in a professional environment. Because it is online it will be very easy to share with others. Kind of like a more in-depth business card. Any visitors to my site will expect to find information about my background, education, and work experience.
It will be useful if they want to know the scope of my skills and expertise. They will be able to look for details on my previous projects and the results. Many visitors may want to understand how to contact me so they can collaborate with me. Potential employers or clients may seek information on my availability and what kind of services I can offer to them. One way that I can use my website is to have something that can pop up when Employers look me up online. I know a lot of employers look up the people that apply for the job and having my own website is a big power move. It puts me in the path of clients as well who might be looking for any of my specific services. It can add additional credibility to my work and give me an edge over competitors.

      </ul>
      <h3>Personal Work</h3>
      <p>
        One way that I can utilize the page is to see how I am accomplishing my goals. I will be able to look back from time to time and see how my progress is on each of my goals and skills. It can work as a sort of archive to see my work overtime and how my professional journey has taken place. Through customization I will be able to make it my own and reflect my unique interests and style. I will be able to include detailed descriptions and images to give the visitors a deeper understanding of my work. I can use the website to measure my progress on my goals and see what I can still improve on. Another way that I can use my website is to get constructive feedback on my goals. I can gain feedback from others that have accomplished similar goals and figure out my next steps when solving problems. Seeing a problem through different lens can sometimes be all it takes to get to the next step of a project.
