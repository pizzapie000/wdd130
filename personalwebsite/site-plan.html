      <p>
        Welcome to my website! This is all about me, the different skills I have developed, and the work that I have been a part of. This page displays some of the main points of my pages and accomplishments, as well as the links to my other pages. I have some of the biggest goals that I have accomplished with a brief overview as well. There are two additional pages linked to this one. One is for my work-related accomplishments and goals, and the other is for my personal goals and things that I have been able to improve about myself. I also included my contact information so that you can contact me. There are also links to my facebook profile. Once I finish my LinkedIn profile, I will be adding that next. This is a way for me to present myself, my work, and my creativity to a wider audience. It allows me to display what sets me apart from others in my own way. Whatever brought you here, I hope that you find all that you need. As time goes on, I will continue to update the page with the newer information and even some useful files like my resume and achievements.

      <h3>Professional Work</h3>
      <p>
        If you are looking for a look into my professional work, you have come to the right place. This page is kind of like a more in-depth business card. Here is where I keep an updated list of different jobs I have worked in, like in food services and a University IT department. You can find information about my education, work experience, leadership skills, and other job-related skills that I have developed over time. Some of those include my accomplishments in Boy Scouts or my own personal business. On some of my projects I have additional information that discusses how I contributed and what we did in a little more detail. I also include some of my goals that I have for the future and what I aspire to become. I also have my contact information here so you can get ahold of me if you have any questions. Whatever reason you are looking at my page, I hope youâ€™re able to find what you are looking for.

      <h3>Personal Work</h3>
      <p>
        Welcome! This page is for my personal goals and projects. It allows me to look back at the things that I have worked on previously and what I can improve on in the future. I have many different hobbies that I am passionate about, and this allows me to display those. This page is more customized to how I keep track of my goals and progress. I have them organized by how much I am currently working on them and how much progress I feel that I have made. Each of these goals has been instrumental to my personal and professional development. It displays what makes me unique as well as my interests and styles. Next to each of the photos I have descriptions on what that skill is specifically and what I have learned about the skill. If you have any feedback on my goals or could help me improve let me know! I leave my information on each page so that I can receive constructive feedback as well. Sometimes seeing a problem through a different lens is all that it takes to complete the next step of a project. One of my next steps for this website is to add a place where visitors can add their own goals and provide feedback on my page.
