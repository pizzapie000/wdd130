        Welcome to my website! This is all about me, the different skills I have developed and the work that I have been a part of. This page specifically is about some of the things I am currently involved in while the other pages go into more detail about my professional and personal goals respectively. 

Currently I am a freshman attending school at BYU Idaho working on my Bachelor’s degree in computer science. I have always been passionate about technology and want to find a career in technology that allows me to build my skills. 

I am also currently working for the Information Technology department at BYU Idaho. The job has helped me find what kind of a workplace I want and what kind of work I want to do. I really like working here because it not only Is building my technology skills, but also my people skills as I work with the faculty and students on campus. 

One of my personal skills that I am building is my leadership skills. I have many different leadership opportunities right now at work and in my personal life. I am over a few different groups and have been learning how to make decisions with confidence while understanding others and their concerns. I have learned to take criticism and become better through failures and successes alike.

      <h3>Professional Work</h3>
      <p>
        If you are looking for a look into my professional work, you have come to the right place. This page is kind of like a more in-depth business card. Here is where I keep an updated list of different jobs I have worked in.	 

I attended college for a semester at a community college in Bakersfield. At the time I worked for food services. This was a fast-paced environment with many moving parts. I needed work that would be easy for me to access while in college and something that would push me. I learned so much while I was there about working as a team and being efficient. I learned about how devastating rumors can be when many of my coworkers spoke poorly about some of the coworkers they disliked. I learned how important it is to have a workplace where hard work is important, but respecting and including coworkers is even more important.

	When I was in High School I owned my own business. I started in the last semester of my freshman year all the way till my last semester as a senior. I sold concessions to students in between classes and learned about managing money, products, and eventually even other students. At the start of my Junior year some students approached me asking how I started my business. I told them how and then I offered them an opportunity to work for me. I supplied them with products at the start of the day and they kept a portion of the pay that they made. It allowed us to learn about sales and it taught me a lot about working with employees and customers.

      <h3>Personal Work</h3>
      <p>
        This page is for my personal goals and projects that I am working on or have worked on. I have many different hobbies that I am passionate about and want to continue improving them.  

	Music: I have always been very passionate about music and performing arts. When I was in third grade I took a small course on learning the recorder and reading simple sheet music. From then on I continued to practice until 5th grade when I could join the school’s band. I picked the clarinet and continued to play all the way until my senior year in high school. When I was in 7th grade I joined the marching band. It was a fantastic way for me to take what I had learned on the clarinet and incorporate marching into it as well.  The other instrument that I play is the drumset. The drumset is a lot different from the clarinet, recorder, and singing because it is all about rhythm. My father and sister both play the guitar and sing so it was a perfect opportunity for me to learn the drums so I could play with them. I have continued to play from 8th grade all the way until now.  

	Cooking: When I was about 5 my mom started teaching me how to cook. Since then I have collected many different cookbooks and recipes that have allowed me to deepen my knowledge of cooking. I mostly cook Mexican and Italian food, but I have been dabbling in asian cooking recently and hope to find a good recipe book I can use to help me. 

	Computers: Similar to how my mom influenced me with cooking, my dad was a large influence on me with the technical side of my life. He works as a computer programmer and as such, we have a lot of computers at home that I have helped build and maintain over the years. I love taking them apart and seeing how they work as well as working on software and coding to speak to the computer. This skill has helped me so much throughout my life to save money and help others with technical issues that they might have. As I study in college I am constantly finding ways that I can improve my skills and I absolutely love it.
